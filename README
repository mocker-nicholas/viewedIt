viewedIt is my first project after taking Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp. The viewedIt application

Solves:

1. Not having an easily accessible reddit history. I click on something, I hit the back button, then that post is
   gone forever unless I can google it.

You should be able to:

1. Set up account
2. Delete account
3. Log in
4. Stay logged in for a week (session)
5. Search for your favorite subreddits
6. Save posts you like
7. Delete posts if you want to
